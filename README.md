# Investa-Transact Analysis

## Project Explanation
This is a basic project that allows you to have an overview on your transactions. 

This gives you a summary of your transactions for your accounts in a more concise manner by highlighting the different transaction types and how much has gone to each type. 

This allows you to track the credits & debits against your account. This highlights the key topic of "Know your money".

### How it works
This project makes use of the *Investec Private Banking API* via this NPM package: [investec-api](https://www.npmjs.com/package/investec-api). This web app is built using NuxtJS, Vue & TailwindCSS.

## Setup

Make sure to install dependencies:

```bash
# npm
npm install

# pnpm
pnpm install

# yarn
yarn install

# bun
bun install
```

## Development Server

Start the development server on `http://localhost:3000`:

```bash
# npm
npm run dev

# pnpm
pnpm dev

# yarn
yarn dev

# bun
bun run dev
```
## Coming Soon
In the next iteration of the project, I will look to deploy it and make it readily available for use without having to run it locally.
